      <h3>My background</h3>
      <p>Am Rosemary Magoma.I had been given this name after the death
         of my granny in the year 1999 June.

       <P>I studied at Savior Kings Academy where I sat for my <em>K.C.P.E.</em> Examination
         and managed to score 300marks.I joined Raila Educational Centre .
          I had really put up my mind on becoming a <em>cardiac surgery</em> but unfortunatly I could not
          since I had only scored a C+.</p>
      <h3>What fascinated me towards studying programming at Moringa School.</h3>
      <p>I had been called to Maasai Mara University
        to pursue a course in Barchelor of Science in Information Science.
      I was supposed to join  the previous month but things never went so.
      well I had consulted a certain teacher of mine at high school about the course
      I was supposed to take in<strong> Maasai Mara</strong> and he advised me to combine my course with IT.
      Since i had done computer basics and I had some knowledge,i convinced my mind
      that I will do IT immediately I finish my university studies .Well my documents got lost and
      all the money we had saved for joining university.I became so frustrated and
      asked God many questions.God opened another way.Shofco called me for an IT
      interview and I passed.That's how I came in Moringa.I really thank God for thos
      very precious opportunity. </p>
